# Tackle

**Tackle 9.0.1** is a model-agnostic planning and execution method. Install: Markdown-only `SKILL.md` plus `references/`. Release changes: changelog.

## Public surface

One entry: `tackle`. State requests in any language. Action names do not register
host commands. Bare invocation or help offers choices without writes. Interpret
requests, including negation and quoted examples; see [invocation.md](references/guides/invocation.md).

| Surface | Request | Result |
|---|---|---|
| **PLAN** | `plan` | Prepare requirements, contracts, task briefs and readiness with the [PLAN card](references/guides/plan-card.md). PLAN-only stops before implementation. |
| **RUN** | `run`, `run --one`, `run <T-id>` | Execute authorized ready tasks with the [RUN card](references/guides/run-card.md): check, correct within budget, integrate and accept delivery. Focused RUN stays inside [lite-plan.tmpl.md](references/lite-plan.tmpl.md). |
| **STATUS** | `status [<workspace>]` | Read-only status, list, next and plain resume. Explicit `--handoff` writes only its projection. |

Use **validate the plan**, **audit the result** and **review lessons** for `verify`, `judge` and
`retro`; `init` forwards to PLAN scaffolding. A diagnostic or standalone STATUS request authorizes no
fix. An explicit resume request that also states execution intent enters RUN after preflight.

## PLAN and RUN

Resolve links from their containing file; locate missing references before retrying. Check named
owner prerequisites first, in a tool call containing only those probes; a missing one stops that
scope with an owner report (the full procedure is in
[intake-and-gate.md](references/guides/intake-and-gate.md), Step 1). Otherwise read named inputs and
retained records before guides; reuse routing or read intake-and-gate.md alone through sizing.

**Direct (None)** uses that bounded procedure without a workspace; **Focused (Lite)** uses only
[lite-plan.tmpl.md](references/lite-plan.tmpl.md); **Coordinated (Full)** loads the [PLAN
card](references/guides/plan-card.md). More guidance requires a specific unresolved capability.

The PLAN card's seven steps take a Coordinated request from intake through readiness validation.
Follow the shared [decision and communication policy](references/guides/communication.md).
Operational diagnosis uses permitted tools; recovery never widens access, product requirements or
authorization.

A Coordinated RUN follows the [RUN card](references/guides/run-card.md); Focused RUN stays inside
[lite-plan.tmpl.md](references/lite-plan.tmpl.md). Distinct executions remain distinct
events even when immutable bytes are shared. Classify other (non-implementation) failures and stop affected work with
records, absent a capability escalation declared in the brief, capped as the RUN card states; do not silently replan or upgrade a model. For blocker reports, use the bounded choices and affected-only wait in the shared communication policy; refusal and time passing do not authorize work.

## Compatibility and state

[Terminology](references/terminology.md) defines visible names, exact state mappings and persistent
aliases. A workspace runs only on the current layout: a `tackle-workspace/5` board with T-ids and `tasks/`, or a Focused plan;
an older one is refused with "migrate first" until [migration](references/guides/migrate.md#forward-only) moves it forward. Complete means every mandatory task obligation passed.
Report method, result and observed independence; a role name or
self-review cannot create independent evidence. Unknown telemetry stays `n/a`.

The task board is canonical current state; history is append-only; current-work projections are
reconstructable. Validate projections against authoritative inputs and checkpoints. Preserve original
history during reversible archival. Protect current, interrupted, unresolved and pinned verification
records; retired bytes cannot support reuse. Maintenance follows an authorized initiative policy;
STATUS never archives or cleans up.

Migrate only selected active workspaces on a disposable copy first, preserve history and correction
lineage, and adopt at an explicit task boundary. Ordinary invocation performs no network access or
installation mutation. Same-release adoption of the selected active copy is held when a required lifecycle row fails; closed records and neighboring workspaces remain untouched.

## Core conventions

1. **Authority order** — user > specification/contract > protected tests/acceptance > implementation. Preferences and hypotheses cannot override this order.
2. **Reference verification** — verify claims against `file:line` or explicitly historical sources; re-anchor stale citations.
3. **Scope** — write only declared task scope and authorized workspace artifacts; preserve unrelated edits.
4. **Task contract** — include observable purpose, requirements, interfaces, cases, constraints, non-goals, approach, checks and recovery; omit only inapplicable fields.
5. **One responsibility** — one task has one coherent observable acceptance target; use an honest command or named review rubric and actual reviewer. Preserve valid alternatives.
6. **Run discipline** — explicit intent precedes mutation; pin procedure, classify failures and preserve shared correction budgets. Apply [code style](references/guides/design-and-contract.md#code-style). Positive Attempts need task-linked failed correction-validation evidence or one task-authorized declared capability escalation; initial checks, dispatch, repeated tests and duplicate events do not add cycles, while unsupported counts stay `n/a`.
7. **Records and independence** — capture actual command, cwd, runtime, actor, revisions, complete streams, exit/timeout/signal and artifact hashes. Every required assertion must propagate failure; `set -u`, `pipefail` or a final PASS alone cannot. Wrapper success cannot hide child failure; reconstructed prose is not raw evidence. Lifecycle Outcome is `running` at start, `success`/`failed`/`blocked`/`aborted` at finish, or `incomplete` on observe-incomplete; product verdict belongs in Verification or Source.
8. **State ownership** — board is current state; log is history; questions and decisions retain their sources. Reconcile `observe-incomplete` before repeating effects; grades derive from records.
9. **Decision ownership** — user owns product choices; reversible technical choices are delegated within scope. Changed acceptance needs a superseding decision.
10. **Learning consent** — select applicable, current lessons; incompatible hypotheses remain historical. Only retro writes profiles after confirmation; backlog ideas are deliberate writes.
11. **Provider independence** — report actual capabilities, model, effort and telemetry; never invent bindings or assume a vendor mechanism. Observe host model names, tier capabilities, binding and effort controls, telemetry and their source before routing; use only actual available models, distinguish supported/unsupported/unknown, keep portable fields separate from host controls, and record unexposed telemetry as `n/a`.

## Output

State the result or useful progress, observed checks and material uncertainty. Ask only when input
changes affected work. No mandatory footers; preserve necessary information over length targets.
